\usage{
\method{plot}{mvreg}(
  x,
  type = c("quantile", "pearson", "response"),
  which = 1:2,
  ask = prod(graphics::par("mfcol")) < length(which) && grDevices::dev.interactive(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{mvreg}.}

\item{type}{character; specifies which residual should be produced in the
envelope plot. The available options are \code{"quantile"} (default),
\code{"pearson"}, and \code{"response"} (raw residuals, y - mu).}

\item{which}{numeric; if a subset of the plots is required, specify a subset
of the numbers 1:5.}

\item{ask}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the user is asked before each plot.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\description{
Five plots (selectable by \code{which}) are currently available:
a plot of residuals against fitted values, a plot of residuals against
the indexes, a Normal Q-Q plot, a barplot with comparisons of the
observed and fitted frequencies, and a plot of the sample autocorelations
of the residuals.

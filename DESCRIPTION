Description: Explore and analyze count data with regression models based on distributions
    parameterized in terms of mean and variance parameters. The 'mvcount' package provides tools for
    estimating model parameters via maximum likelihood and diagnostic analysis using goodness-of-fit
    metrics and residual analysis. The implemented models are suitable for various applications with 
    distributions that handle overdispersed, equidispersed, or underdispersed count data, in 
    addition to achieving deflation or inflation of zeros concerning the Poisson distribution.
